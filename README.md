# ShellGame
This Github repository begins with Version 67, already in production @ theaigames.com .

Project is written in Java.  There are four essential modules: ManxFourBot, FourState, MonteCarloNode, and Timer.
TestManxCarlo uses Junit to, amongst other things, run a full game of the bot versus itself.
